# M4 Macros for Electric Circuit Diagrams in TROFF
These are modified m4 configuration files for electric circuit diagrams with groff macros.

## M4 macro documentation
The documentation can be found on https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.604.2295&rep=rep1&type=pdf. While this was intended for Latex, it works alright with groff, you only have to watch out for text formatting differences in labels.
## Instructions
1. Put libgen.m4 and libcct.m4 in any directory
2. Put gpic.m4 in any directory (can be same as libgen.m4 and libcct)
3. Change the `-I` argument inside chroff to the directory containing libcct.m4 and libgen.m4
4. Change gpic.m4 argument in chroff accordingly
and with that the setup is done. To test it:
1. Copy example from documentation or write your own in a `.m4` file
2. Run chroff <name_of_file_without extension>
3. check the PDF
For a quicker example, run `chroff out` after cloning this repository.

## Caveats
This was made by an EE student and is a work in progress, so expect spaghetti shell script. I regularly use this for lab reports and will improve it whenever I discover problems.
